###### Hyderabad Marketplace 


The Hyderabad market place is one of the biggest in the country. It has a wide range of stores and a lot of people from all over the world come here to shop. There are also many ***restaurants*** and ***cafes*** that are found here. I like this place very much.

There are some amazing places to eat, shop, and hang out in Hyderabad. Some of these places include:


- Birla Mandi

- Falaknuma Palace

- Golconda Fort

- Charminar
