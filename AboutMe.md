# Prasanna Konakanchi
I am a native speaker of English. I have four brothers and one sister. My father is an engineer and my mother is a teacher.I have been working as a copywriter for three years now. I enjoy writing about personal finance, lifestyle, and dieting topics.One of the most interesting things about me is that I am a self-proclaimed nerd who loves playing video games and watching TV shows from the past decade or so.
